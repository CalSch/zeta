uhh its gonna be a z80 fancy home computer but not really. like picotron but instead of yucky lua its the z80. it's very much not done, but it will have 3 parts: an emulator, a kernel, and userspace programs. right now, it only really works on my computer so dont be surprised when it doesnt work.

for more stuff, look at notes.md

i used [libz80](https://libz80.sourceforge.net/) for the z80 emulator. i might make some changes like adding a multiply or divide instruction but thats for later.

ok bye
